Hello,

It's time for Surge!  I must admit, this is one of my favorite conferences of the year.  

Thank you for signing up for the [Introduction to Chef tutorial](http://surge.omniti.com/2014/speakers/speakers.html?harvey-nathen) on Wednesday.  I'll be leading that tutorial and we're going to have a lot of fun and learn a thing or two along the way.

We'll talk about infrastructure as code, devops, continuous delivery, and compliance.  There will be lots of hands-on time and we need to be sure everyone comes prepared and ready to dive right in.
