# Introduction to Chef - Surge 2014

Chef is an automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. This is a hands-on tutorial that will cover the basics that everyone needs to know about how to use Chef for system and infrastructure management. We’ll discuss the server API, the code primitives, and the tools required to successfully use Chef.

## Video Streams

We live-streamed this session using a Google Hangout.  Quality is OK but check out these videos if you'd like to watch and listen to the class.

## Logistics

This session will rum from 10AM to 5PM with a break for lunch.  Lunch is not served as part of the session but there are a number of locations nearby.

This session will be held in the Eastern Shore II conference room.

### Prerequisites
* Watch [Overview of Chef](http://learn.getchef.com/fundamentals-series/week-1/) (45 minutes) on [learnchef.com](http://learnchef.com)
* Complete the [Workstation Requirements](#workstation-requirements), listed below
* Comfort with a command-line text editor such as [vim](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html), [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/), or [nano](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)

* Have a question you want addressed?  
  * Add it to the [student_questions.md](student_questions.md) file and submit a pull request
  * Or, email [Nathen](mailto:nharvey@getchef.com) in advance

#### Nice to haves

These prerequisites aren't actually required but will be helpful in making the class experience delightful:

* a working knowledge of Git
* an account on [GitHub](http://github.com)


### Workstation Requirements
Attendees should bring a wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop. The following operating systems have been tested as workstation systems with the hands on exercises:

* A wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop, either
  * Ubuntu 12.04+
  * Mac OS X 10.8+
  * Windows 7+

#### Required software to be installed before class

Attendees should install the following required software before the workshop starts.

- ChefDK (http://downloads.getchef.com/chef-dk) 0.2.2+
- SSH/SCP (OpenSSH, puTTY/WinSCP or equivalent)
- Programmer’s text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/), Vi/Vim, Emacs, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), or equivalent)

**Note for Ruby Developers**

If you're currently using rvm, rbenv, chruby, or some other Ruby version manager, you may need to disable that to have ChefDK work as expected during class.  See the [Using ChefDK as Your Primary Development Environment](https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk#using-chefdk-as-your-primary-development-environment) section of the ChefDK README for more information.

#### Nice to haves

Though we might make use of these in the class, you'll probably want them afterwards

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

It is also a good idea to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed.
